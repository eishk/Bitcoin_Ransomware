Project by Eish Kapoor, Kyle Mondina, & Matt Seminatore
For reducing the dataset and pre-processing, assignBinaryLabels, preprocess, & scrambleData were used.
The models relating to our models presented in our report are in paperNotebook.ipynb/.html, with all of our runs and overall work in totalProjectWork.pynb
The dataset we used for this project is in the .csv file
